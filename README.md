# tree-view-menu

## Introduction

Show a button when mouse enters a file or folder entry in tree-view.

Click on this button can do one of things below:

1. Call a menu which contains frequently used buttons you selected in the setting panel.
2. Do an operation which is set by you in the setting panel.

## p.s.

1. This package is developed for use case of opening single project in atom,
so there may be some problems when open multiple projects or no project files in atom. If you happen to get any problem, please create an issue in the [this package's repo](https://github.com/yubaoquan/tree-view-menu).

2. When developing this package, the node in atom was in version 7.4.0, and the syntax `async/await` ran well. I think some atom in lower version would have trouble with new ES syntax(not investigated). So make sure your atom version is up to date.

## demo

Because the original demo2 and demo3 images and their clearly compressed ones are so big (over 8M each) that it may not be seen directly in this page. So I have to also put blurry ones to this page. I add the links of clearly versions as well. You can see the clearly version gif in [this package's repo](https://github.com/yubaoquan/tree-view-menu).
